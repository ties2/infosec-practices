# Information Security Assignments

This repository contains a collection of 20 practical, technical assignments designed to simulate real-world information security scenarios. These exercises cover **Incident Response**, **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**, **Web Log Analysis**, **Python Scripting**, and **Kubernetes Security**. Each assignment includes a detailed task description, difficulty level, estimated time, and step-by-step solution process.

The goal is to provide hands-on practice for skills relevant to information security roles, inspired by common interview labs and challenges.

## Structure
Assignments are organized into five categories:
- **[Incident Response](#incident-response)**: Phishing, ransomware, and exfiltration scenarios.
- **[IAM](#iam)**: Privilege management and security in cloud/Kubernetes environments.
- **[Web Log Analysis](#web-log-analysis)**: Detecting attacks in server logs.
- **[Python Scripting](#python-scripting)**: Automating security tasks with Python.
- **[Kubernetes](#kubernetes)**: Securing containerized environments.

Each assignment is stored in the `assignments/` directory, grouped by category.

## Usage
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/infosec-assignments.git`
- Navigate to an assignment: `cd assignments/<category>/<assignment>.md`
- Follow the steps in each Markdown file to practice in a lab environment (e.g., VirtualBox, AWS, Minikube).
- Tools recommended: Wireshark, `kubectl`, Python, AWS CLI, etc.
